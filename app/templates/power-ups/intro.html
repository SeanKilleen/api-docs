	<h2>Power-Ups Introduction</h2>
	<p>Power-Ups are powerful independent modules that allow developers to modify the Trello experience while still maintaining member control. Power-Ups represent the ability to enrich the experience of members by modifying and improving their interactions with Boards and Cards. Power-Ups are currently only available to members as part of <a href="https://trello.com/business-class">Business Class</a> or <a href="https://trello.com/enterprise">Enterprise</a>.
	</p>
